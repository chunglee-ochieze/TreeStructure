# TreeStructure

This is a simple Perfect Tree Structure console app implementation in .NET5.

Run console app and specify the intended depth of the perfect tree.

Application constructs the perfect tree, then positions the elements to form a perfect binary tree.

While forming the perfect binary tree, one of the leaf nodes is deliberately allowed to bear a zero value.

Thereafter, the label of the zero valued leaf node is predicted.

To validate the prediction, a zero value search is run on the tree, to confirm the prediction.
